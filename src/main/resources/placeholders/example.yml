# -----------------------------
# AirCore Custom Placeholders
# -----------------------------

# You can create your own .yml files and sub-folders within the /placeholders/ directory
# Example: /placeholders/staff/tags.yml

# %aircore_key_[key]% to use placeholders anywhere

# The 'fallback' field is optional
# - If provided: The placeholder will return this text when conditions are not met
# - If omitted: The placeholder will not parse (remain as %...%) if conditions are not met

# Supported operators:
# ==  : Equals (Case-sensitive)
# !=  : Not Equals (Case-sensitive)
# =~  : Equals (Case-insensitive)
# !~  : Not Equals (Case-insensitive)
# |-  : Starts with
# -|  : Ends with
# <>  : Contains
# ><  : Does not contain
# >   : Greater than (Numeric)
# <   : Less than (Numeric)
# >=  : Greater than or equal (Numeric)
# <=  : Less than or equal (Numeric)

placeholders:
  # Example 1: Basic Boolean Toggle
  example:
    conditions: "%aircore_player_toggle_god% == true"
    output: "[GOD]"
    fallback: "[MORTAL]"

  # Example 2: String comparison, equals (case-insensitive)
  player_name_equals:
    conditions: "%player_name% =~ 'FTxEven'"
    output: "Yes"

  # Example 3: String comparison, not equals (case-insensitive)
  player_name_notequals:
    conditions: "%player_name% !~ 'FTxEven'"
    output: "Yes"

  # Example 4: String comparison, starts with
  starts_with:
    conditions: "%player_name% |- 'f'"
    output: "It starts with f"
    fallback: "It doesn't start with f"

  # Example 5: String comparison, ends with
  ends_with:
    conditions: "%player_name% -| 'n'"
    output: "It ends with n"
    fallback: "It doesn't ends with n"

  # Example 6: String comparison, contains
  contains:
    conditions: "%player_name% <> 'eve'"
    output: "It contains eve"
    fallback: "It doesn't contain eve"

  # Example 7: String comparison, does not contains
  doesnot_contains:
    conditions: "%player_name% >< 'eve'"
    output: "It doesn't not contains eve"
    fallback: "It contain eve"

  # Example 8: Numeric comparison
  greater_than:
    conditions: "%aircore_player_balance_raw% > 1000000"
    output: "$$$ %aircore_player_balance_short%"
    fallback: "$ %aircore_player_balance_short%"

  # Example 9: Condition chain (Both must be true)
  conditions_chain:
    conditions:
      - "%luckperms_primary_group_name% == 'admin'"
      - "%aircore_player_balance_raw% > 100"
    output: "%player% is Admin and has >$100"

  # Example 10: Multiple condition priority & condition chain
  # Priority 0 is checked first. If it fails, it moves to 1, and so on.
  conditions_chain_priority:
    priority:
      0: # Highest priority
        conditions:
          - "%aircore_player_balance_raw% >= 100"
          - "%player_name% == 'ftxeven'"
        output: "%player% has >=$100"
      1:
        conditions:
          - "%aircore_player_balance_raw% > 1000"
        output: "%player% has >$1000"
      2:
        conditions:
          - "%aircore_player_balance_raw% > 10000"
        output: "%player% has >$10000"
