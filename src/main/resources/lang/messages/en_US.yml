# AirCore Language Configuration
# -------------------------------
# General Notes:
# - Set a message to "" to disable it (nothing will be sent).
# - All messages support full MiniMessage formatting.
# - External placeholders are supported when PlaceholderAPI is installed.
#
# Supported Inline Tags (usable inside any message):
#   <sound:NAME:VOLUME:PITCH>
#       - Plays a sound to the player
#
#   <title:'TEXT':fadeIn:stay:fadeOut>
#       - Shows a title with timing values (in ticks)
#
#   <subtitle:'TEXT'>
#       - Shows a subtitle (uses the last title timings)
#
#   <actionbar:'TEXT'>
#       - Shows text in the action bar
#
#   <bossbar:'TEXT':duration:color:progress:countdown>
#       TEXT      = message displayed in the boss bar
#       duration  = how long to display (ticks, 20 ticks = 1 second)
#       color     = boss bar color (e.g., RED, BLUE, GREEN)
#       progress  = initial progress (0.0–1.0, used in static mode)
#       countdown = true/false: true animates progress toward 0, false keeps it static
